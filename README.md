# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

When you push to the `main` branch, the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build and deploy the site.

You can also trigger the deployment manually from the GitHub Actions tab.
